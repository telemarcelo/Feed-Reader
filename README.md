###Feed Reader Test

##To Operate:
Simply open index.html in a browser to access feeds.  Use hamburger menu to get a list of different feeds.
##About:
The purpose of this project is to implement various tests to test the functionality of a feed reader.

Tests were implemented as specified in order to test that  feeds are defined, url's exist, names exists and are not empty, menu opens and closes, articles load, and finally that they load different content.

I only tested that the initial feed has contents and that the contents in feed one and two are different.
I tried to implement loops to check all of the feeds but I could not get loops to work with beforeEach.  In looking at the forums it seems that what I have is sufficient.

##Error Handling
The tests have been implemented to handle most errors.
